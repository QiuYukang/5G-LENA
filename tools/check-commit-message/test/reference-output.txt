Commits that failed check 'CheckPrefix'
  Checked rules:
   1.Commits touching up to 3 distinct files should use their lowercase, extension-less names as the prefix, provided that the resulting prefix is at most 40 characters long. When those names share a common prefix, a single '<common-prefix>-*' wildcard is also allowed.
   2.Commits touching more than 3 distinct files, or for which no filename-based prefix fits within 40 characters, should use their closest common parent directory as a prefix.
